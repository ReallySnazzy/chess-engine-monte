# Chess Engine

This is a chess engine I implemented that uses a monte carlo simulation that prioritizes capturing pieces. It can communicate with tools like [Cute Chess](https://cutechess.com/) through the UCI protocol. This chess engine does better than random or perhaps a very new player, but it is too naive. This chess engine does not really factor in what the opponent will do and is focused more on capturing pieces than winning.
